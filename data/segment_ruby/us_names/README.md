# US names

These frequencies from from US 2013 Social Security Death Master Index.
First and last names were lowercased, all spaces were removed, and
then frequencies were counted.

For example:

- "Jane" was counted as both a first and as a last name.
- The first name "Mary Ann" had spaces removed, and so was counted along
  with "MaryAnn"
- Variants such as "O'Reilly" and "OReilly" were _not_ merged (Although "O Reilly" and "OReilly" were merged).

The original data comes from the US Social Security Agency; the data was 
provided by [Tom Alciere](http://cancelthesefunerals.com/).
